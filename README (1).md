Smooth Moves

A little webpage to try and utilize smooth movement in UX training.
This particular challenge is to just use JS, HTML and CSS.


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```

Or just download the files, using VSCODE (other applications are available) run the HTML 'start debugging'  and you can have a look, play around.

This is a continuous work in progress.
